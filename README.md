Placements in the blue color jobs market or the vocational sector is a specialized segment often overlooked by the larger job portals specifically for women as they focus mainly on corporate profiles. A candidate searching for a blue collar job in India may not have a fancy resume or college degree needed by the large job portals to get placed. In order to bridge this gap we have launched a recruitment platform specifically designed for the vocational sector seamlessly integrated with Sector Skill Councils (SSC) and Training Partners. We are a recruitment platform where entry level and experienced blue collar jobs can be searched in good companies across India.
